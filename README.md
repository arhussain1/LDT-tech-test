## Startlist Dashboard

### What am I doing?/What are my goals?

For this project I aim to create a simple dashboard that allows organisers to see who is participating in their races alongside any relevant information. In addition, organisers will also be able to filter booking so they can see only their startlist entries and the amount they made in ticket sales.

#### The requirements for this project are listed below:

You have been asked to build a dashboard that makes it easy for for organisers to view race startlist entries and ticket sale revenue.

1. It must be possible for organisers to apply a filter so that they can see only their startlist entries.
2. It must also be possible for each organiser to see how much they have made in ticket sales.

#### Technologies 
I aim to use React JS to create a Front End application, I aim to make the dashboard on a single page.

### My approach
This section details my approach to this tech test

#### Stage 1 - Planning

Researched for examples of race startlists from other companies such as runbritain and findarace

most important information included are:
  - First Name 
  - Last Name
  - Gender
  - Club/affiliation

I will include the following information to begin:
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Status
  - Event Name
  - Organiser Name

I also researched an example of a dashboard made using React. I hope to include a side panel which will include various filters that an organiser can use to customise the table of results. 

From this I quickly made a mockup of how I wanted the app to look.
